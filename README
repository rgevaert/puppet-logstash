Logstash puppet module.

include logstash

If you want to disable using the upstream repo do:

class {
 'logstash':
    major_release => '';
}

You can also override the default major release by passing something like '1.X'.

By default the config installed is useless.  You need to override yourselves with the config_template parameter'
